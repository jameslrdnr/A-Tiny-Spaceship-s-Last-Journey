# A-Tiny-Spaceship-s-Last-Journey
Fun game designed by James Lardner, Garrett Egan, Andrew Beiter &amp; Niko Kumar

This game was built from the absolute ground up with zero external libraries (exception of one used by Niko for sound). This
was done intentionally in order to familiarize ourselves with the inner workings of Java and to ensure that we would not
take advantage of what others had done. We reinvented the wheel in order to learn how one can go about doing such a thing.

This game was mainly built by James Lardner and Garrett Egan.

James Lardner focused on the "Engine" development as well as the outlying features of each screen. This was followed up by 
developing the randomly generated map and enemies. I then introduced a particle system and the ability for color transitions
mid game. The hardest task however was making sure that everyones code was able to be merged. 

Garrett Egan focused mainly on the development of the player object as well as enemy behavior. He added the ability for saving
of files as well as the option screen.
